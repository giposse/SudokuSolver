# SudokuSolver
Project to solve Sudokus, which is the result of an academic exercise on code simplicity

This project came up from a self imposed challenge to improve coding when it comes to simplicity.   There is a blog about the exercise which you can read at [add link to Blog here].

The purpose of this project was not to come up with a Sudoku Solver which would solve any puzzle, but to explore and learn.   This code will solve Sudoku puzzles up to a certain point (pretty advanced ones for what I can tell).   It includes techniques like locked cells, Almost Locked Sets, X-Wings, SwordFish, and Jellyfish, plus all the flavors of these (Sashimi and Finned).   It includes XY- Wings, XYZ-Wings, remote pair technique, basic coloring, and 3D-Medusa coloring.  

I hope you will enjoy and benefit from it in some way as I did writing the code.
